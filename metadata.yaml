description: Author Annie F. Johnston was first inspired to create the beloved children's
  literature character known as the Little Colonel after a run-in with a supremely
  self-possessed little boy who reminded her of the imperious mannerisms of her grandfather,
  a high-ranking officer in the Confederate army. In this novel, a later entry in
  the series, a key plot point is finally resolved as Lloyd chooses a bride.
